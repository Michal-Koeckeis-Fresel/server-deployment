# Contributor License Agreement (CLA) Information

## üìã Overview

This project requires all contributors to sign a **Contributor License Agreement (CLA)** before their contributions can be accepted.

### What does the CLA do?

- **Copyright Assignment**: You assign copyright of your contributions to **Michal Koeckeis-Fresel**
- **Dual Licensing**: Enables the project to remain dual-licensed under MIT OR AGPL-3.0
- **Legal Protection**: Protects both you and the project from legal issues

## üîó How to Sign the CLA

### Automatic Process (Recommended)
1. **Submit a Pull Request** - Our CLA Assistant will automatically comment
2. **Click the CLA link** in the bot comment
3. **Sign in with GitHub** and agree to the terms
4. **Your PR will be updated** automatically once signed

### Manual Process
If you prefer to sign manually or have questions:
1. Review the [CLA Document](https://gist.github.com/Michal-Koeckeis-Fresel/fffd154945ce87b9e9ba9803734aca81)
2. Comment on your PR: `I have read the CLA Document and I hereby sign the CLA`

## üìÑ CLA Document Content

By signing, you agree that:

1. **Copyright Assignment**: You assign all rights in your contributions to Michal Koeckeis-Fresel
2. **License Grant**: You grant perpetual rights to license under MIT, AGPL-3.0, or other licenses
3. **Representations**: You own the copyright and have authority to make this assignment
4. **Original Work**: Your contributions are original or you have rights to contribute them

## ‚ùì Common Questions

**Q: Why do you need copyright assignment?**
A: This allows us to maintain dual licensing (MIT OR AGPL-3.0) and make licensing decisions for the entire codebase.

**Q: Can I still use my contributions elsewhere?**
A: Yes, you retain the right to use your contributions in other projects.

**Q: What if I contribute on behalf of my employer?**
A: Your employer must sign the CLA, or you must confirm you have authority to assign copyright.

**Q: Can I revoke the CLA?**
A: No, the copyright assignment is irrevocable, but this only affects future use of your contributions.
